## Introduction
This project is an **AI-Powered Recommendation System** designed to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences, behaviors, or historical interactions. It can be applied to various domains like e-commerce, movie streaming, content suggestions, etc.

### Use Cases:
- Product recommendations for online stores.
- Movie or book recommendations for streaming platforms.
- Personalized content suggestions for social media apps.

## Features
- Uses **collaborative filtering**, **content-based filtering**, and **hybrid models**.
- Built-in support for implicit and explicit feedback.
- Scalable and optimized for performance.
- Easy to integrate with existing systems.

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data processing.
- **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, or **PyTorch** for building machine learning models.
- **Streamlit** (optional) for creating a web-based interface.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x** is required.
- Familiarity with machine learning and data science is recommended.
- Ensure you have `pip` for package installations.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recommendation-system-ai.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd recommendation-system-ai
(Optional) Create a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your dataset and place it in the data/ directory.
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open recommendation_system.ipynb and run the cells.
(Optional) To launch the Streamlit web interface:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Example Usage
python
Copy code
from recommender import RecommenderSystem

# Initialize the recommender
recommender = RecommenderSystem()

# Load data and train the model
recommender.load_data("data/user_ratings.csv")
recommender.train()

# Get recommendations
user_id = 123
recommendations = recommender.get_recommendations(user_id)
print(f"Recommendations for User {user_id}: {recommendations}")
Dataset
The recommendation system expects a dataset in CSV format with columns like:

user_id: Unique identifier for users.
item_id: Unique identifier for items (products, movies, etc.).
rating: User's rating for the item (for explicit feedback).
timestamp (optional): When the interaction occurred.
